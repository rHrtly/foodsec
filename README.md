Abstract: The persistence of disadvantage across generations is a central concern for social policy in the United States. While an extensive literature has focused on income mobility, much less is known about the persistence of material hardship. Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we estimate the intergenerational persistence of food insecurity. Childhood food insecurity is associated with at least 10 percentage points higher probability of food insecurity as an adult, with estimates varying by severity of childhood exposure, life-course timing, and accounting for endogeneity and underreporting. We explore potential mechanisms behind this persistence related to perceptions, behaviors, and human capital.

Replication files include two Stata .dta files and one .do file to produce estimates in the manuscript and online appendix. The log files are available showing the data construction and the estimation. The .do file requires the following programs available via the Boston College Statistical Software Components (SSC) archive: b1x2, ivreg2, weakivtest, weakiv, tabstatmat.
